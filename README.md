# MANTRIX
Predicting impacts of praying mantids using fuzzy interaction webs

# Description
Developing tools for rapidly predicting which introduced species will become invasive 
is essential for effective management. Itâ€™s also notoriously difficult. 
Quantitative models exist but often require extensive data, precluding timely application. 
Fuzzy Interaction Webs (FIW), a qualitative modeling approach, offer a practical alternative. 
FIWs hold the potential to predict impacts, guide early responses, and identify 
research needs using the limited data commonly available on an invasion front. 
As a case study, we applied FIW to a European praying mantis (*Mantis religiosa*) 
invasion in grassland communities of western Montana, USA. Modeling was done using 
the [MPG Matrix online tool](https://matrix.mpgranch.com/#/gallery)

# Directory of Reports
- **[Mantid observations](mantid_observations_mt.md).** See where mantids have been observed 
in western Montana and how many have been seen in recent years. These data are from 
[iNaturalist's](https://www.iNaturalist.org) citizen scientists.
- **[Mantid FIW parameters](mantid_abundance_pcis.md).** Read a summary of how we obtained 
mantid abundance and interaction strength estimates.
- **[Predicted impacts](sensitivity_analysis_results.md)** of mantids on native species vary, 
but are severe at high mantid abundances. Periodic cold snaps and parasitoids may 
dampen impacts.

# Fuzzy Interaction Webs
Two baseline FIWs were created to test nine scenarios. Scenarios 1-4 test the effects of increased
mantid abundance on the grassland community. Scenarios 5-9 test the effects of winter severity
and parasitoid wasps on mantid populations. Link to the scenarios on the MPG Matrix below. 
Reference the **How To Use** guide, accessible from the website header, and the 
[FAQ sheet](https://matrix.mpgranch.com/#/faq) to duplicate and modify the FIWs.
